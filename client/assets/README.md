# Audio Assets

Place your audio files in this directory:

- `bg-music.mp3` - Background music (will be looped)
- `shoot.mp3` - Sound effect for shooting fireballs
- `hit.mp3` - Sound effect for hitting/destroying monsters

**Note:** The game will work without these files, but audio will be disabled. You can use any MP3 files or create placeholder audio files for testing.
